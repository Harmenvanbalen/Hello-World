George Dance the younger, RA (1 April 1741 â€“ 14 January 1825) was an English architect and surveyor as well as a portraitist.

The fifth and youngest son of the architect George Dance (the elder), he came from a family of architects, artists and dramatists. He was described by Sir John Summerson as "among the few really outstanding architects of the century", but few of his buildings remain.
